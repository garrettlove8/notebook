# Chapter 3. Creational Patterns
- Abstraction that hides an object's creation, composition, and representation details
- Class creational patterns will use change the class being instantiated
- Object creational patterns will handoff instantiation to another object
- Two themes in creational patterns
    - They hold the knowledge about which classes the system uses
    - They hide how the class are created and put together
- Sometime these patterns can compete with one another and other times they can work in a complimentary form
- Creational patterns provide ways to remove remove hard-coded references to classes from the code that needs to instantiate them
