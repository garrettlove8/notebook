# Part II - The Right People
- Every product begins with the people on the product team
  - These people will likely be a determining factor the success or failure of the product
- Part two of this book describes the roles and responsibilities of modern tech-powered product teams

# Product Teams
## Overview
Most important concept of the entire book

```
It's all about the product team
```

# Chapter 9 - Principles of Strong Product Teams
- Product teams are sometimes called a `dedicated product team` or a `durable product team` to illustrate that the teams are not temporarily created to work on a single project of feature
- Bring together people with different areas of expertise
  - The people get to feel real sense of ownership over the product or piece of the product they're making

## Team of Missionaries
```
"We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries" - John Doerr
```

- `Mercenaries` build and do what they are told, while `missionaries` truely believe in the vision they're working towards and are committed to solving problems for their customers
- A dedicated product team is intentionally structured such that it acts as its own startup withing the larger company

## Team Composition
- Comprised of a product manager, product designer, and anywhere from 2 - 12 engineers
  - In the event that your product doesn't have a front-end you can leave out the designer
  - In some cases, a product team may also have a marketing manager, a couple test automation engineers, user researcher, data analyst, and delivery manager

## Team Empowerment and Accountability
- A foundational concept for product teams is that they exist to solve hard problems for the business
- They are empowered to figure out how to best deliver a solution to the problems they are given to solve

## Team Size
- No rules on the size
- Critical mass is around one product manager, one designer, and two engineers
  - Some teams may decide this number is more
- The upper limit is around 8 - 12 engineers
- A balance of skills is more important than the number of people on the team

## Team Reporting Structure
- A product team is intentionally kept flat
- There is generally no concept of a people manager that everyone reports to
  - Everyone continues to report to their functional manager. For example, engineers would still report to an engineering manager who isn't on that product team
  - The product manager is not the *boss* of the other people on a product team

## Team Collaboration
- The whole point of a product team is for the product manager, designer(s), engineers, etc. to work *together* on solving hard problems

## Team Location
- The team is usually co-located
  - Meaning team memebers actually sit right next to one another
- A co-located team is going to outperform a distributed team
- This is why it's important for product teams to be actual employees of the company and not contractors or agencies
- While it's ok for companies to have multiple locations, it's important to have teams co-located

## Team Scope
- The dimensions to consider to determine the scope for a product team
  - Type of work
  - Scope of work
- The type of work should be anything and everything related to their product
  - Ex: All the projects, features, bug fixes, performance work, optimizations, and content changes
- The scope of work
  - It is more common today that a product team will be responsible for a full customer experience
  - This is easy for startups that only have one or a few product teams, but as companies grow it gets harder to divide the work accordingly
- Dividing the pie can happen in a number of ways, however the most important thing is that there is alignment between product management and engineering
  - Based on customer or user
  - Based on type of device
  - Based on workflow or customer journey
- There is never a perfect way to slice the pie
  - Optimizing for one thing will come at the expense of another thing

## Team Duration
- There is no set amount of time that a team should remain intact
  - That said, a team that knows each other and works well together **is not** something that should be taken for granted and we should try our best to keep them together
- It can take time for a team to develop the necessary expertise to solve the problems they're have been brought together to solve
  - This exertise is necessary to innovate and is another reason we want to keep teams together
- It also takes time for teams to develop a sense of ownership and develop that missionary-like passion we want

## Team Autonomy
- Teams can't just work on whatever looks fun, but in order to help them feel empowered and develop that missionary-like passion, it is important that they be able to solve a problem in whatever way they feel is best
- It is also necessary to minimize dependancies bewteen teams
  - While it simply isn't possible to completely eliminate them (especially at scale), it is important to minimize them so that teams can have the necessary autonomy to feel empowered and missionary-like

## Why It Works
1. Collaboration is built on relationships and having a team that is together for the long-haul gives them the ability to form these relationships
2. In order to innovate you need a level of expertise and having a team that is durable allows each memeber to go deep enough into the problem to develop that expertise
3. Instead of building what they are told, the entire product team understands the business need and context surrounding that need. The team doesn't simply push deliverables and their mission is not done until they have solved the problem for the business and the deliverable is working
4.
