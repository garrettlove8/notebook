# Preface
- `It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they aren't given something worthwhile to build`
- `The state of the art is very different from the state of the practice`

# Chapter 1
## Behind Every Great Product
- Behind every great product there is someone who works non-stop, leading the team to combine tech and design to solve customer problems
  - Often a product manager, startup co-founder, or CEO
  - Sometime someone else who just saw a need
- The product management role is very different than design, engineering, marketing, or project manager roles

# Chapter 2
## Technology-Powered Products and Services
- This book focuses on products that are powered by tech
  - Ex: Apps, E-commerce platforms, social media, business services, etc.

# Chapter 3
## Startups: Getting to Product/Market Fit
- Companies fall into three stages
  - Startups, growth-stage, and enterprise companies
- New product company that hasn't yet found a product/market fit
- Ie. Still trying to find a product capable of centering a business around
- Product manage role is usually filled by one of the co-founders
- Less than 25 engineers and upto four or five product teams
- Companies at this stage are in a race to find product/market fit before they run out of money
  - This means a huge focus on product is needed
  - Early funding is meant to allow the startup to figure out if it can find a product/market fit
- Successful startups are usually the ones that are really good at product discovery

# Chapter 4
## Growth-Stage Companies: Scaling to Success
- Startups that find product/market fit now need to grow and scale their business
- Increased hiring, new products and services, and grow the core business as quickly as possible
- Between 25 and a couple hundred engineers
- The struggles at this point are of a different nature
  - Product teams have trouble understanding how their work contributes to the bigger picture
  - Sale and marketing complain that the strategies used for the first product won't work as well for the new product(s)
  - Engineers complain about technical debt due to decisions that were made in order to get the first product working
- Leaders may struggle because the styles and techniques that worked early on may not work well anymore
  - Roles and behaviors often change at this point
- Motivation is strong because an IPO or aqcuisition are possible
  - Also there is huge potential to have an impact on the world

# Chapter 5
## Enterprise Companies: Consistent Product Innovation
