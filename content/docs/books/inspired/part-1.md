# Preface
- `It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they aren't given something worthwhile to build`
- `The state of the art is very different from the state of the practice`

# Chapter 1
## Behind Every Great Product
- Behind every great product there is someone who works non-stop, leading the team to combine tech and design to solve customer problems
  - Often a product manager, startup co-founder, or CEO
  - Sometime someone else who just saw a need
- The product management role is very different than design, engineering, marketing, or project manager roles

# Chapter 2
## Technology-Powered Products and Services
- This book focuses on products that are powered by tech
  - Ex: Apps, E-commerce platforms, social media, business services, etc.

# Chapter 3
## Startups: Getting to Product/Market Fit
- Companies fall into three stages
  - Startups, growth-stage, and enterprise companies
- New product company that hasn't yet found a product/market fit
- Ie. Still trying to find a product capable of centering a business around
- Product manage role is usually filled by one of the co-founders
- Less than 25 engineers and upto four or five product teams
- Companies at this stage are in a race to find product/market fit before they run out of money
  - This means a huge focus on product is needed
  - Early funding is meant to allow the startup to figure out if it can find a product/market fit
- Successful startups are usually the ones that are really good at product discovery

# Chapter 4
## Growth-Stage Companies: Scaling to Success
- Startups that find product/market fit now need to grow and scale their business
- Increased hiring, new products and services, and grow the core business as quickly as possible
- Between 25 and a couple hundred engineers
- The struggles at this point are of a different nature
  - Product teams have trouble understanding how their work contributes to the bigger picture
  - Sale and marketing complain that the strategies used for the first product won't work as well for the new product(s)
  - Engineers complain about technical debt due to decisions that were made in order to get the first product working
- Leaders may struggle because the styles and techniques that worked early on may not work well anymore
  - Roles and behaviors often change at this point
- Motivation is strong because an IPO or aqcuisition are possible
  - Also there is huge potential to have an impact on the world

# Chapter 5
## Enterprise Companies: Consistent Product Innovation
- After going through the growth state, companies still need to innovate with the product(s) they offer
  - Not just tweak and optimize existing products (called `value capture`)
  - Must develop each product to its full potential
- Death of enterprise companies is slow
  - Starts to happen when the company only leverages the value and brand it had create years or decades earlier
  - Often happens once the company is publicly traded
  - So many stateholders to the point that exciting new initiatives or ventures are shut down because it could jeopardize the core business
  - Could also come from too many obsticles to make it worth people's effort to revitalize the business
- Symptoms are clear
  - Lower morale, lack of innovation, and taking more time to launch products
- The company has likely achieved the mission it had as a startup and people don't know what's next
- People in different roles now complain about different things
  - **Product** teams complain about lack of vision, empowerment, and that it takes too long for decisions to be made
  - **Leadership** is frustrated by the lack of innovation from the product teams
    - This leads them to acquire other companies or setup innovation labs which usually don't give them what they want

# Chapter 6
## The Root Causes of Failed Product Efforts
- Companies use a flawed approach to creating new products

- `Ideas` come from either inside the companie or outside
  - Ex: Inside the company may be from executives, key stakeholders, or business owners
  - Ex: Outside the company may be from current or prospective customers
- Ideas are then prioritized into a `roadmap`
  - First reason: Get teams to work on the most important thing first
  - Second reason: Predict when things will be ready
  - Leadership will then hold a quarterly or annual planning session
    - Product roadmap is negotiated during this time
    - Sounds like the t-shirt sizing stuff that just happened at Tendo
  - They'll also determine a `business case` for each item
    - This answers two questions: `1. How much will it make?` and `2. How much will it cost?`
- Once the roadmap is done the product manage will talk to stakeholders to determine the `requirements`
  - Could be user stories or functional
- The requirements are given to the `design` team
- Designs are given to the engineers to `build` the product
  - Usually where agile workflows are introduced
- The product then goes to QA for `testing`
  - Ideally testing happens throughout development
  - QA ensure the product works as advertised and doesn't result in other problems (called `regressions`)
- Once QA approves the product is `deployed` and available to customers


- This is how most companies work, while complaining about the lack of innovation
- While engineers might be following as much of an *agile workflow* as they can, the overall process is more *waterfall*

### Problems This Process
1. The source of ideas
  - Leads to sales-driven specials and stakeholder-driven products
  - Lack of team empowerment
    - Teams are really just there to implement what they're told
2.
